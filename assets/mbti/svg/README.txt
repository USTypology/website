SVG symbol set generation notes:
Each icon pair (male / female) uses shared base geometry with subtle variation in stroke treatment and internal accent form.
Naming convention: <type-lowercase>-m.svg and <type-lowercase>-f.svg
Color palette (base fill or stroke accent):
  NT (Rationals)  #6B3FA0
  NF (Idealists)  #0C8D8F
  SJ (Guardians)  #C79A00
  SP (Artisans)   #D96C00
Structural encoding (abstract):
  Outer shape edge orientation encodes E vs I (outward radiating vs inward nested)
  Primary motif encodes dominant function domain:
    Triangle = Thinking
    Circle / curved = Feeling
    Square / stable = Sensing
    Star / ray / spiral = Intuition
  Male variant: slightly more angular cap element
  Female variant: slightly more curved / rounded accent
All icons are 120x120, purely geometric (no gendered human silhouettes) to avoid stereotypes.
